Liver cancer is cancer that begins in the cells of your liver.

 Your liver is a football-sized organ that sits in the upper right portion of your abdomen,
 beneath your diaphragm and above your stomach.

Several types of cancer can form in the liver.

 The most common type of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma, which begins in the main
 type of liver cell (hepatocyte).

 Other types of liver cancer, such as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatoblastoma,
 are much less common.

Cancer that spreads to the liver is more common than cancer that begins in the liver cells.

 Cancer that begins in another area of the body — such as the colon, lung or breast — and
 then spreads to the liver is called metastatic cancer rather than liver cancer.

 This type of cancer is named after the organ in which it began — such as metastatic colon 
cancer to describe cancer that begins in the colon and spreads to the liver.

Causes

Liver cancer happens when liver cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA.

 A cell's DNA is the material that provides instructions for every chemical process in
 your body.

 DNA mutations cause changes in these instructions.

 One result is that cells may begin to grow out of control and eventually form a
 tumor — a mass of cancerous cells.

Sometimes the cause of liver cancer is known, such as with chronic hepatitis infections.

 But sometimes liver cancer happens in people with no underlying diseases and it's not clear what causes it.
